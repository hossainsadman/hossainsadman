# :wave: Hi, I'm Sadman!
I'm an incoming engineering student at the University of Toronto, and I'm passionate about implementing software systems to make progress towards problems that haven't been solved before. I like competitive programming, graphic design, and table tennis. Currently exploring embedded systems, web development, and machine learning.

# :wave: Hey, I'm Sadman!
I'm an incoming engineering student at the University of Toronto (:mortar_board:), and I'm passionate about implementing software systems to make progress towards problems that haven't been solved before (:zap:). 

I like competitive programming, graphic design, and table tennis. 

Currently exploring embedded systems, web development, and machine learning.
